### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the slightly chaotic profile of Joakim Ewenson, a hobbyist developer that likes to try out new languages and almost complete projects.

I've been writing things in PHP since before this millenium but apparently, PHP is a bit hated and therefore I'm trying out some new things like vanilla JavaScript and recently, React.

I also enjoy creating more or less meaningless stuff in Python and have created apps for Android and iOS using both Kotlin as well as Flutter.

Most of the things that I do is in Swedish, for Swedish conditions and Swedish users, so if you don't understand Swedish you might find some of the things in here a bit confusing. It's OK, just continue down the endless lane of internet wierdness instead OR, if you think you found something usefull but don't understand it, send me a message!

I've got a slightly dead blog (in Swedish) over at https://www.ewenson.se and my main side project for many years can be found at https://utf.nu, but that site is very specific for Swedish traindrivers and others working in the railroad sector.

If you know any secrets on how to focus on a specific project and actually complete it, do share! If not, hope you did enjoy reading this ramble and if you want to know how it's done, you can visit https://www.aboutmonica.com/blog/how-to-create-a-github-profile-readme#how-do-i-create-a-profile-readme!
